Hi All, I have just pushed Hardware version 1.5 to Git (diydrones/PXF)

This fix addresses the UART issues, removes the i2c RGB led, adds power for the UBLEDs, Renames the UARTS as ttyO0, ttyO4, and ttyO5

Removes the Spektrum from UART and connect it dirrectly to PPM

PPM/S.Bus Out is now connected to PRU0_R30[15] could be used for pass through.

S.Bus inverter is no longer used, and has been removed.

ttyO0 is connected directly to the Debug header, there is nothing in the way of this other than a series resistor.
